      "text": "Imagine you're on a smoothly gliding train, completely isolated from the outside world.  You toss a ball straight up in the air; it falls straight back down to your hand.  To you, the ball's motion is purely vertical.  However, to someone standing still outside the train, the ball is also moving horizontally along with the train's velocity.  This illustrates the principle of relativity: the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.  This seemingly simple idea, championed by Galileo centuries before Einstein, was a crucial stepping stone.  Einstein took this principle and extended it to encompass the speed of light, paving the way for his revolutionary theory.",

      "text": "Einstein's Special Relativity, the first part of his theory, hinges on two postulates: 1) The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion (as illustrated earlier). 2) The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source. This second postulate is counterintuitive!  Imagine shining a flashlight while running.  Common sense suggests the light's speed should be the speed of light *plus* your running speed.  However, according to relativity, the speed remains a constant – approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. This constancy has profound implications, leading to time dilation and length contraction.",
